# Change Log

## [TODO]
### Add
- Wrapper to Vector / Matrix in order to use a vector as a matrix and a matrix as a vector without copying data

- JeometryFactory `createPoint3D(Vector)`
- Matrix matrix norms (see (Here)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_norm])
- Test implements Point2DTest

### Change
- Refactor Matrix `setTo` to `setValues`
- Refactor Quaternion `mult` into `product`
- Refactor make all xxxAffect() methods to return a reference on the object instead of `void` in order to chain processing
- Refactor make all setValue(s) methods to return a reference on the object for chaining purpose
