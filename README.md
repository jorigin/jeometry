# JEometry
A Java based Geometry toolkit. This library enable to deal with 2D/3D points, meshes and various algorithm.

## Usage
JEometry is available at Maven Central. To import the library just add the following dependency to your maven project:
```xml
<TODO>
```
## Changes:

### TODO
  - Add set(Matrix) to Matrix, this method affect the input matrix to the current one
  - Add createTransformation3DMatrix(Matrix) to geometry factory
  - Implements SVD decomposition
  - Implements LU decomposition
  - Implements linear solvers
  - Refactor getMatrix / setMAtrix within Matrix in order to handle sizes
  
### 1.0.0
  + Initial release.
